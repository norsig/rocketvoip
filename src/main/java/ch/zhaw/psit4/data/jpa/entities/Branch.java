/**
 * Branching to another dialplan, based on key press.
 *
 * It depends on BranchDialPlan, since apart from backing a branch with Asterisk Goto()s, a hangupTime is required
 * as well (which will be passed to Asterisk WaitExten()). In other words, a Branch is a collection of Goto()s together
 * with a WaitExten().
